Greetings and salutations BarCampers!

It's that time of year again!  We will be hosting the thirteenth annual BarCampGR will be on Friday, August 24 and Saturday, August 25, 2018 at Calvin College's DeVos Communications Center.  Come meet interesting people, sit in on talks about interesting things, and give that talk you've always wanted to give!
